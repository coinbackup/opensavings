    <p><b>Open Savings Initiative</b> lets you set aside cryptocurrency that can only be spent after a certain date. It's like
    a certificate of deposit that you can add more money to anytime, but doesn't require a bank.</p>

    <p>If you intend to give cryptocurrency to someone else, you can use <b>Open Savings Initiative</b> to create the crypto
    equivalent of writing a check for a future date. Unlike traditional cheques, the crypto cheque can't bounce, can't be
    cancelled, and is guaranteed to have the funds.</p>

    <p>This app doesn't collect or store any personal data.</p>

    <p><b>Open Savings Initiative</b> is an open source project. View the code on <a href="https://github.com/coinbackup/opensavings" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

                TL;DR&mdash;The app uses the <code>OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY</code> opcode to build a pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address. The coins sent to
                the P2SH address are only spendable by a newly generated private key, which is given to the user for safe keeping, digitally or printed.
                This effectively creates a time-locked paper wallet.
            </p>
            
            <hr>
            <p>The script used to build the P2SH (i.e. the "redeem script") is:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;timestamp&gt; OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG </code></pre>
            <p>
                This is a standard pay-to-pubkey-hash (P2PKH) script, but with a time-locking element added to it. The script to spend coins at this P2SH
                address (i.e. the "scriptSig") is:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubKey&gt; &lt;redeemScript&gt; </code></pre>
            <p>
                Just as with a common P2PKH transaction, only the owner of a specific address may spend the coins sent to the P2SH address. We'll call this person
                the "recipient".
            </p>
            <p><code>&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> is a date and time specified by the user&mdash;the coins are unspendable until this time.</p>
            <p><code>&lt;pubKeyHash&gt;</code> is the recipient's address.</p>
            <p><code>&lt;sig&gt;</code> is the signature of the transaction, signed with the recipient's private key.</p>
            <p><code>&lt;pubKey&gt;</code> is the recipient's public key.</p>
            <p><code>&lt;redeemScript&gt;</code> is the serialized redeem script.</p>
            <p>
                The recipient's private key must be used in order to spend the time-locked coins, and typical wallets don't support spending from nonstandard
                P2SH address like this one. To get around this problem (and <b>not</b> require the user to export his wallet's private keys in order to use them
                in this app), the app generates a fresh private key to use as the recipient. The user must keep this private key safe.
            </p>
            <p>The user is given this new private key, along with the redeem script. This is all that's needed to spend the coins.</p>
